## 1 - Introduction

This repository is intended to provide information on the **Finite State Machine** feature available in some [STMicroelectronics](www.st.com/mems) sensors.

Finite State Machine processing allows moving some algorithms from the application processor to the *STMicroelectronics* sensor, enabling consistent reduction of power consumption. The sensor can be configured to detect user-defined motion patterns.

A Finite State Machine is a mathematical abstraction used to design logic connections. It is a behavioral model composed of a finite number of states and transitions between states, similar to a flowchart in which it is possible to inspect the way logic runs when certain conditions are met. The state machine begins with a *Start* state, goes to different states through transitions dependent on the inputs, and finally ends in a specific state (called *Stop* state). The current state is determined by the past states of the system.

The results of the Finite State Machine can be read from the application processor at any time. Furthermore, there is the possibility to **generate an interrupt** when a user-defined motion patterns is detected.


## 2 - Repository folder structure

This repository contains different folders which identify sensor part numbers supporting the **Finite State Machine** feature.

Each folder related to the sensor part number contains sub-folders with examples of **Finite State Machine** configurations. See a typical path below:

````Path
\lsm6dsox\Shake detection\
````

## 3 - Example sub-folder file description 

Each example sub-folder contains:

- a `xxxxxxx.ucf` file, where  `xxxxxxx` identifies the example. The `.ucf` file is the standard format for **Unico GUI**, which allows device configuration. *Unico GUI* is available for: [Windows](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/evaluation-tool-software/stsw-mki109w.html), [Linux](<https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/evaluation-tool-software/stsw-mki109l.html>), [Mac OS X](<https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/evaluation-tool-software/stsw-mki109m.html>).

- a `xxxxxxx.h` file, where  `xxxxxxx` identifies the example. This file is a *C programming language header* and can be generated by *Unico GUI*.

  Some examples of  `xxxxxxx.h` file integration are available at [platform independent drivers repository]( http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mems-and-sensors-software/drivers-for-mems/c-driver-mems.html ) for *STMicroelectronics* sensors.

- README.md: additional info about the specific example.


## 4 - Required properties

For using *C header* files (`.h`):

> * A standard C language compiler for the target MCU
> * A C library for the target MCU and the desired interface (ie. SPI, I2C)

For using *Unico GUI* Configuration Files (`.ucf`):

> * Unico GUI for device configuration


## 5 - Examples

The examples can be used with:

- **Unico GUI** (available for: [Windows](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/evaluation-tool-software/stsw-mki109w.html), [Linux](<https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/evaluation-tool-software/stsw-mki109l.html>), [Mac OS X](<https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/evaluation-tool-software/stsw-mki109m.html>)) and  [Professional MEMS Tool board](<https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mems-motion-sensor-eval-boards/steval-mki109v3.html#overview>) (STEVAL-MKI109V3)
  - Run *Unico GUI* selecting the desired device, then go to the *Load/Save* tab, and load the *Unico GUI* Configuration File (`.ucf`)
- Any *C-programmable* hardware
  - Include the C header file (`.h`) in the desired project
  - Use the desired interface C library for the target *MCU* for writing the array configuration contained in the *C header* file (`.h`)
  - Some examples of integration are available at [platform independent drivers repository]( http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mems-and-sensors-software/drivers-for-mems/c-driver-mems.html ) for *STMicroelectronics* sensors.
