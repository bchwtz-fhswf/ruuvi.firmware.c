# SHTC3 Sample Code for STM32

This uVision sample project shows the basic usage of Sensirion's SHTC3
temperature and humidity sensor.

## Compatibility

The code herein is compatible with Sensirion's SHTC3 digital temperature and
humidity sensor.

* Sensirion SHTC3 Sensor
* STM32 Discovery board ([STM32VLDISCOVERY])
* uVision (5.25)

## System Requirements

 * Windows PC
 * SHTC3 Sensor
 * STM32-Discovery board from STMicroelectronics ([STM32VLDISCOVERY])
 * USB type A to mini-B cable

## Getting Started

 1. Download the latest version of Microcontroller Development Kit for ARM
    (MDK-ARM). The software can be used without a product license for a maximum
    code size of 32 Kbytes.
    *Tested Version: 5.25*
 2. Run the Installer and follow the instructions. (MDK525.EXE)
 3. Open the project file `shtc3-stm32.uvprojx`.
 4. Press F7 or click ![build target icon](images/uvision-build.png) to build
    the target.
 5. Connect the SHTC3 Sensor to the STM32-Discovery board:

    |Discovery board|SHTC3-Sensor|
    |---------------|------------|
    | 3V3           | VDD        |
    | BP8           | SCL        |
    | BP9           | SDA        |
    | GND           | GND        |
    Also connect pull-up resistors (e.g. 10kOhm) from SCL and SDA to VDD and
    add a decoupling capacitor between VDD and GND.

 6. Connect the STM32-Discovery board to the PC with the USB cable.
 7. Start the debugger by pressing Ctrl+F5 or click Debug in the menu â†’
    Start/Stop Debug Session ![Debug icon](images/uvision-debug.png).
 8. Press F5 or click ![the run program icon](images/uvision-run.png) to run the
    program.
    The green LED lights if no error occurs, in this case the communication
    with the sensor works. The blue LED lights up when a relative humidity of
    more than 50% is measured. You can simulate this by breathing on the
    sensor.
 9. Add the variables error, id, temperature, and humidity to the watcher or
    set a breakpoint to check the values.
